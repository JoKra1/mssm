    #
    # Some thoughts:
    # The resulting proposal is not a sample from P(State | obs, current_par) as done in the classical stochastic expectation step (Nielsen, 2000).
    # In principle if we increase n_prop and leave temp==1, state_dist should however become a close representation of this distribution (assuming we
    # monitor burn in and correlation between candidates). Not sampling directly from P(State | obs, current_par) also seems to be a feature of
    # Stochastic approximate Expectation Maximization or Stochastic Simulated Annealing Expectation Maximization.
    # However, these approaches seem to form an iterative approximation of Q: Q_{t+1} = Q_{t-1} + lambda * Q_{t},
    # where Q_{t} is based on the stochastic/approximate E step, and then maximize Q_{t+1} (see Celeux, Chauveau & Diebolt, 1995; Delyon, 1999).
    # We simply maximize the CDL based on our candidate - which IS again closer to traditional SEM.
    # The sampler for the most general case (se_step_sms_gamm) behaves more like traditional SEM so the acceptance step is not necessary (might however improve convergence?).
    # For temp != 1 we really use simulated annealing and do not form a sample to approximate P(State | obs, current_par) any longer. Why? The idea
    # is that in later iterations (temp < 1) we should have a relatively good estimate so approximating the entire P(State | obs, current_par) is not that
    # important, rather we want to look more and more (the more temp < 1) at similarly likely new candidates so that we don't oscillate widely around a
    # good estimate.

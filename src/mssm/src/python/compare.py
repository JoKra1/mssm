    """ Computes the AIC difference and (optionally) performs an approximate GLRT on twice the difference in unpenalized likelihood between models ``model1`` and ``model2`` (see Wood et al., 2016).
    
    For the GLRT to be appropriate ``model1`` should be set to the model containing more effects and ``model2`` should be a nested, simpler, variant of ``model1``.
    For the degrees of freedom for the test, the expected degrees of freedom (EDF) of each model are used (i.e., this is the conditional test discussed in Wood (2017: 6.12.4)).
    The difference between the models in EDF serves as DoF for computing the Chi-Square statistic. In addition, ``correct_t1`` should be set to True, when computing the GLRT.
    
    To get the AIC for each model, 2*edf is added to twice the negative (conditional) likelihood (see Wood et al., 2016).
    
    By default (``correct_V=True``), ``mssm`` will attempt to correct the edf for uncertainty in the estimated :math:`\\lambda` parameters. Which correction is computed depends on the
    choice for the ``grid`` argument. **Approximately** the analytic solution for the correction proposed by Wood, Pya, & SÃ¤fken (2016) is computed  when ``grid='JJJ1'`` (the default) - which is exact for
    strictly Gaussian and some canonical Generalized additive models. This is too costly for very large sparse multi-level models and not exact for more generic models. The MC based alternative available via ``grid = 'JJJ2'`` addresses the first problem (**Important**, set: ``use_importance_weights=False`` and ``only_expected_edf=True``.). The second MC based alternative
    available via ``grid_type = 'JJJ3'`` is most appropriate for more generic models (The ``prior`` argument can be used to specify any prior to be placed on :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\rho}` also you will need to set: ``use_importance_weights=True`` and ``only_expected_edf=False``).
    For more details consult the :func:`mssm.src.python.utils.correct_VB` function, the examples below, and Krause et al. (submitted).

    In case any of those correction strategies is too expensive, it might be better to rely on hypothesis tests for individual smooths, confidence intervals, and penalty-based selection approaches instead (see Marra & Wood, 2011 for details on the latter).

    In case ``correct_t1=True`` the EDF will be set to the (smoothness uncertainty corrected in case ``correct_V=True``) smoothness bias corrected exprected degrees of freedom (t1 in section 6.1.2 of Wood, 2017),
    for the GLRT (based on recomendation given in section 6.12.4 in Wood, 2017). The AIC (Wood, 2017) of both models will **still be based on the regular (smoothness uncertainty corrected) edf**.

    The computation here is different to the one performed by the ``compareML`` function in the R-package ``itsadug`` - which rather performs a version of the marginal GLRT
    (also discussed in Wood, 2017: 6.12.4) - and more similar to the ``anova.gam`` implementation provided by ``mgcv`` (particularly if ``grid='JJJ1'). The returned p-value is approximate - very **very**
    much so if ``correct_V=False`` (this should really never be done). Also, the GLRT should **not** be used to compare models differing in their random effect structures - the AIC is more appropriate for this (see Wood, 2017: 6.12.4).

        ### Model comparison and smoothness uncertainty correction for very large strictly additive model

    :type b: float, optional
    :param df: Degrees of freedom used for the multivariate t distribution used to sample/propose the next set of candidates. Setting this to ``np.inf`` means a multivariate normal is used for sampling, defaults to 40

    :type verbose: bool, optional
    :param drop_NA: Whether to drop rows in the **model matrices** corresponding to NAs in the dependent variable vector. Defaults to True.
    :type drop_NA: bool,optional
    :param method: Which method to use to solve for the coefficients (and smoothing parameters). The default ("Chol") relies on Cholesky decomposition. This is extremely efficient but in principle less stable, numerically speaking. For a maximum of numerical stability set this to "QR/Chol". In that case a QR decomposition is used - which is first pivoted to maximize sparsity in the resulting decomposition but also pivots for stability in order to get an estimate of rank defficiency. A Cholesky is than used using the combined pivoting strategy obtained from the QR. This takes substantially longer. If this is set to ``'qEFS'``, then the coefficients are estimated via quasi netwon and the smoothing penalties are estimated from the quasi newton approximation to the hessian. This only requieres first derviative information. Defaults to "Chol".
    :type method: str,optional
    :param seed: Seed to use for random parts of the correction. Defaults to None
    :type seed: int,optional
    :param only_expected_edf: Whether to compute edf. by explicitly forming covariance matrix (``only_expected_edf=False``) or not. The latter is much more efficient for sparse models at the cost of access to the covariance matrix and the ability to compute an upper bound on the smoothness uncertainty corrected edf. Only makes sense when ``grid_type!='JJJ1'``. Defaults to None - meaning that ``mssm`` will select an appropriate value.
    :type only_expected_edf: bool|None, optional
    :param Vp_fidiff: Whether to rely on a finite difference approximation to compute :math:`\\mathbf{V}_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}` or on a PQL approximation. The latter is exact for Gaussian and canonical GAMs and far cheaper if many penalties are to be estimated. Defaults to False (PQL approximation)
    :type Vp_fidiff: bool,optional
    :param use_importance_weights: Whether to rely importance weights to compute the numerical integration when ``grid_type != 'JJJ1'`` or on the log-densities of :math:`\\mathbf{V}_{\\boldsymbol{\\rho}}` - the latter assumes that the unconditional posterior is normal. Defaults to None - meaning that ``mssm`` will select an appropriate value.
    :type use_importance_weights: bool | None,optional
    :param prior: An (optional) instance of an arbitrary class that has a ``.logpdf()`` method to compute the prior log density of a sampled candidate. If this is set to ``None``, the prior is assumed to coincide with the proposal distribution, simplifying the importance weight computation. Ignored when ``use_importance_weights=False``. Defaults to None
    :type prior: any, optional
    :param recompute_H: Whether or not to re-compute the Hessian of the log-likelihood at an estimate of the mean of the Bayesian posterior :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\beta}|y` before computing the (uncertainty/bias corrected) edf. Defaults to None - meaning that ``mssm`` will select an appropriate value.
    :type recompute_H: bool | None, optional
    :param compute_Vcc: Whether to compute the second correction term when `grid='JJJ1'` (or when computing the lower-bound for the remaining grids) or only the first one. In contrast to the second one, the first correction term is substantially cheaper to compute - so setting this to False for larger models will speed up the correction considerably. Defaults to None - meaning that ``mssm`` will select an appropriate value.
    :type compute_Vcc: bool | None, optional
    :param bfgs_options: An optional dictionary holding arguments that should be passed on to the call of :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize` if ``method=='qEFS'``. If none are provided, the ``gtol`` argument will be initialized to ``conv_tol``. Note also, that in any case the ``maxiter`` argument is automatically set to ``max_inner``. Defaults to None.

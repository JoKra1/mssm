        Fit the specified model.

        **Note**: Keyword arguments are initialized to maximise stability. For faster configurations (necessary for larger models) see examples below.
        
        :param init_coef: An initial estimate for the coefficients. Must be a numpy array of shape (-1,1). Defaults to None.
        :type init_coef: np.ndarray,optional
        :param max_outer: The maximum number of fitting iterations.
        :type max_outer: int,optional
        :param max_inner: The maximum number of fitting iterations to use by the inner Newton step for coefficients.
        :type max_inner: int,optional
        :param min_inner: The minimum number of fitting iterations to use by the inner Newton step for coefficients. By default set to ``max_inner``.
        :type min_inner: int,optional
        :param conv_tol: The relative (change in penalized deviance is compared against ``conv_tol`` * previous penalized deviance) criterion used to determine convergence.
        :type conv_tol: float,optional
        :param extend_lambda: Whether lambda proposals should be accelerated or not. Can lower the number of new smoothing penalty proposals necessary for models with heavily penalized functions. Disabled by default.
        :type extend_lambda: bool,optional
        :param extension_method_lam: **Experimental - do not change!** Which method to use to extend lambda proposals. Set to 'nesterov2' by default.
        :type extension_method_lam: str,optional
        :param control_lambda: Whether lambda proposals should be checked (and if necessary decreased) for whether or not they (approxiately) increase the Laplace approximate restricted maximum likelihood of the model. For ``method != 'qEFS'`` the following options are available: setting this to 0 disables control. Setting it to 1 means the step will never be smaller than the original EFS update but extensions will be removed in case the objective was exceeded (only has an effect when setting ``extend_lambda=True``). Setting it to 2 means that steps will generally be halved when they fail to increase the aproximate REML criterion. For ``method=='qEFS'`` the following options are available: setting this to 0 disables control. Setting it to 1 means the check described by Krause et al. (submitted) will be performed to control updates to lambda. Setting it to 2 means that steps will generally be halved when they fail to increase the aproximate REML criterion (note, that the gradient is based on quasi-newton approximations as well and thus less accurate). Setting it to 3 means both checks (i.e., 1 and 2) are performed. Set to 2 by default if ``method != 'qEFS'`` and otherwise to 1.
        :type control_lambda: int,optional
        :param restart: Whether fitting should be resumed. Only possible if the same model has previously completed at least one fitting iteration.
        :type restart: bool,optional
        :param optimizer: Deprecated. Defaults to "Newton"
        :type optimizer: str,optional
        :param method: Which method to use to solve for the coefficients (and smoothing parameters). "Chol" relies on Cholesky decomposition. This is extremely efficient but in principle less stable, numerically speaking. For a maximum of numerical stability set this to "QR/Chol" or "LU/Chol". In that case the coefficients are still obtained via a Cholesky decomposition but a QR/LU decomposition is formed afterwards to check for rank deficiencies and to drop coefficients that cannot be estimated given the current smoothing parameter values. This takes substantially longer. If this is set to ``'qEFS'``, then the coefficients are estimated via quasi netwon and the smoothing penalties are estimated from the quasi newton approximation to the hessian. This only requieres first derviative information. Defaults to "QR/Chol".
        :type method: str,optional
        :param check_cond: Whether to obtain an estimate of the condition number for the linear system that is solved. When ``check_cond=0``, no check will be performed. When ``check_cond=1``, an estimate of the condition number for the final system (at convergence) will be computed and warnings will be issued based on the outcome (see :func:`mssm.src.python.gamm_solvers.est_condition`). Defaults to 1.
        :type check_cond: int,optional
        :param piv_tol: Deprecated.
        :type piv_tol: float,optional
        :param progress_bar: Whether progress should be displayed (convergence info and time estimate). Defaults to True.
        :type progress_bar: bool,optional
        :param n_cores: Number of cores to use during parts of the estimation that can be done in parallel. Defaults to 10.
        :type n_cores: int,optional
        :param seed: Seed to use for random parameter initialization. Defaults to 0
        :type seed: int,optional
        :param drop_NA: Whether to drop rows in the **model matrices** and observations vectors corresponding to NAs in the observation vectors. Set this to False if you want to handle NAs yourself in the likelihood function. Defaults to True.
        :type drop_NA: bool,optional
        :param init_lambda: A set of initial :math:`\\lambda` parameters to use by the model. Length of list must match number of parameters to be estimated. Defaults to None
        :type init_lambda: [float],optional
        :param form_VH: Whether to explicitly form matrix ``V`` - the estimated inverse of the negative Hessian of the penalized likelihood - and ``H`` - the estimate of the Hessian of the log-likelihood - when using the ``qEFS`` method. If set to False, only ``V`` is returned - as a :class:`scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator` - and available in ``self.lvi``. Additionally, ``self.hessian`` will then be equal to ``None``. **Note**, that this will break default prediction/confidence interval methods - so do not call them. Defaults to True
        :type form_VH: bool,optional
        :param use_grad: Deprecated.
        :type use_grad: bool,optional
        :param build_mat: An (optional) list, containing one bool per :class:`mssm.src.python.formula.Formula` in ``self.formulas`` - indicating whether the corresponding model matrix should be built. Useful if multiple formulas specify the same model matrix, in which case only one needs to be built. Only the matrices actually built are then passed down to the likelihood/gradient/hessian function in ``Xs``. Defaults to None, which means all model matrices are built.
        :type build_mat: [bool], optional
        :param should_keep_drop: Only used when ``method in ["QR/Chol","LU/Chol","Direct/Chol"]``. If set to True, any coefficients that are dropped during fitting - are permanently excluded from all subsequent iterations. If set to False, this is determined anew at every iteration - **costly**! Defaults to True.
        :type should_keep_drop: bool,optional
        :param gamma: Setting this to a value larger than 1 promotes more complex (less smooth) models. Setting this to a value smaller than 1 (but must be > 0) promotes smoother models! Defaults to 1.
        :type gamma: float,optional
        :param qEFSH: Should the hessian approximation use a symmetric rank 1 update (``qEFSH='SR1'``) that is forced to result in positive semi-definiteness of the approximation or the standard bfgs update (``qEFSH='BFGS'``) . Defaults to 'SR1'.
        :type qEFSH: str,optional
        :param overwrite_coef: Whether the initial coefficients passed to the optimization routine should be over-written by the solution obtained for the un-penalized version of the problem when ``method='qEFS'``. Setting this to False will be useful when passing coefficients from a simpler model to initialize a more complex one. Only has an effect when ``qEFS_init_converge=True``. Defaults to True.
        :type overwrite_coef: bool,optional
        :param max_restarts: How often to shrink the coefficient estimate back to a random vector when convergence is reached and when ``method='qEFS'``. The optimizer might get stuck in local minima so it can be helpful to set this to 1-3. What happens is that if we converge, we shrink the coefficients back to a random vector and then continue optimizing once more. Defaults to 0.
        :type max_restarts: int,optional
        :param qEFS_init_converge: Whether to optimize the un-penalzied version of the model and to use the hessian (and optionally coefficients, if ``overwrite_coef=True``) to initialize the q-EFS solver. Ignored if ``method!='qEFS'``. Defaults to False.
        :type qEFS_init_converge: bool,optional
        :param prefit_grad: Whether to rely on Gradient Descent to improve the initial starting estimate for coefficients. Defaults to True.
        :type prefit_grad: bool,optional
        :param repara: Whether to re-parameterize the model (for every proposed update to the regularization parameters) via the steps outlined in Appendix B of Wood (2011) and suggested by Wood et al., (2016). This greatly increases the stability of the fitting iteration. Defaults to True if ``method != 'qEFS'`` else False.
        :type repara: bool,optional
        :param init_bfgs_options: An optional dictionary holding the same key:value pairs that can be passed to ``bfgs_options`` but pased to the optimizer of the un-penalized problem. If this is None, it will be set to a copy of ``bfgs_options``. Only has an effect when ``qEFS_init_converge=True``. Defaults to None.
        :type init_bfgs_options: dict,optional
        :param bfgs_options: An optional dictionary holding arguments that should be passed on to the call of :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize` if ``method=='qEFS'``. If none are provided, the ``gtol`` argument will be initialized to ``conv_tol``. Note also, that in any case the ``maxiter`` argument is automatically set to ``max_inner``. Defaults to None.

        Importantly, predictions and standard errors are always returned on the scale of the linear predictor. For the Gaussian GAMMLSS model, the 
        predictions for the standard deviation will for example usually (i.e., for the default link choices) reflect the log of the standard deviation.
        To get the predictions on the standard deviation scale, one could then apply the inverse log-link function to the predictions and the CI-bounds
        on the scale of the respective linear predictor. See the examples below.

        generalized additive models. Here :math:`w_i` are the Fisher scoring weights, :math:`z_i` the pseudo-data point for each observation, and :math:`\\eta_i` is the linear prediction (i.e., :math:`g(\\mu_i)` - where :math:`g()`

        :param dat1: A pandas DataFrame containing new data for which to make the prediction. Importantly, all variables present in the data used to fit the model also need to be present in this DataFrame. Additionally, factor variables must only include levels also present in the data used to fit the model. If you want to exclude a specific factor from the prediction (for example the factor subject) don't include the terms that involve it in the ``use_terms`` argument.
        :type n_dat: pd.DataFrame
        :param dat2: A second pandas DataFrame for which to also make a prediction. The difference in the prediction between this ``dat1`` will be returned.
        :type dat2: pd.DataFrame
        :param use_terms: The indices corresponding to the terms that should be used to obtain the prediction or ``None`` in which case all terms will be used.
        :type use_terms: list[int] or None
        :param alpha: The alpha level to use for the standard error calculation. Specifically, 1 - (``alpha``/2) will be used to determine the critical cut-off value according to a N(0,1).
        :type alpha: float, optional
        :param whole_interval: Whether or not to adjuste the point-wise CI to behave like whole-function interval (based on Wood, 2017; section 6.10.2 and Simpson, 2016). Defaults to False.
        :type whole_interval: bool, optional
        :param n_ps: How many samples to draw from the posterior in case the point-wise CI is adjusted to behave like a whole-function interval CI.
        :type n_ps: int, optional
        :param seed: Can be used to provide a seed for the posterior sampling step in case the point-wise CI is adjusted to behave like a whole-function interval CI.
        :type seed: int or None, optional
        :return: A tuple with 2 entries. The first entry is the predicted difference (between the two data sets ``dat1`` & ``dat2``) ``diff``. The second entry is the standard error ``se`` of the predicted difference. The difference CI is then [``diff`` - ``se``, ``diff`` + ``se``]

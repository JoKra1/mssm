mssm Documentation
==================

This is the documentation of the **public** API of ``mssm``. The entire source code is available for inspection on `GitHub <https://github.com/JoKra1/mssm>`_.
For the purpose of **applying** the models available in this toolbox, the documentation here should however be sufficient.

``mssm`` is a Python toolbox to estimate Generalized Additive Mixed Models (**GAMMs**), Generalized Additive Mixed Models of Location Scale
and Shape (**GAMMLSS**), and more general smooth (mixed) models (**GSMMs**) in the sense defined by `Wood, Pya, & SÃ¤fken (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2016.1180986>`_.
mssm is an excellent choice for the modeling of multi-level time-series data, often estimating additive models with separate smooths for thousands of levels in a couple of minutes.
